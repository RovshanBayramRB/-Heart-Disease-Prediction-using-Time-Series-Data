In this project, I have used ECG200 dataset from the UCR archive. This is the time series dataset in which each series traces the electrical activity recorded during one heartbeat. The target for this project was to predict the cases of Ischemia and Normal cases of heartbeats. I have used simple Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (or Multilayer Perceptron), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model, namely, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). For the implementation of model, I have used well-known libraries which are Keras and TensorFlow.
